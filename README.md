# TechTask_2
TechTask_2 is a program that reads numbers from a file, searches among these numbers for the minimum number, the maximum number, and counts their total sum and product.
In the directory src\tests contains tests that check the correctness of the functions (TestFunction), as well as load tests (TestLoadFunction).

Below is a graph of the dependence of the operating time of the function _max on the number of numbers.
